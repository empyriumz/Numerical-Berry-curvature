# Numerical-Berry-curvature
Numerical implementation of Berry curvature calculation for tight binding Hamiltonians.

This numerical routine has been used for calculating the magneto-tranpsort properties in several topological materials.

See [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 166601](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.166601) for results.

## Requirement
Mathematica 10.0 or higher

Optional: [MaTeX](https://github.com/szhorvat/MaTeX) package for using LaTeX in Mathematica
